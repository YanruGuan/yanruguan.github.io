<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Yanru Guan, an undergraduate in the [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm) at Peking University (EECS ’27), and I am spending Spring 2026 as an exchange student at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science.

My research interests lie in **algorithmic game theory** and **computational economics**, with a focus on auction theory and mechanism design. I am particularly interested in understanding how incentives, information, and strategic behavior interact in algorithmic systems. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm) at Peking University.

I served as a Teaching Assistant for various courses at both Carnegie Mellon University and Peking University, and I am honored to have had worked with Profs [Yang Liu](https://yangpliu.github.io/), [Richard Peng](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yangp/) and [Shaofeng Jiang](https://www.shaofengjiang.cn/).

Beyond research, I have been deeply engaged in competitive programming for more than a decade. I placed **5th at the ICPC World Finals 2025** and was awarded a Gold Medal and the Best Female Player distinction at National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) 2022.
